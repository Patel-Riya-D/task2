# 🚢 Task-2 : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome aboard! This repository contains a complete Exploratory Data Analysis of the famous **Titanic dataset** — where data meets disaster, and insights emerge from the depths.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Use data visualization and statistics to explore survival patterns on the Titanic.  
Understand how features like **age**, **gender**, **passenger class**, and **embark location** influenced survival.

## 📊 Key Insights

🔹 Women and children had **higher survival rates**  
🔹 Passengers from **1st class** were more likely to survive  
🔹 Most passengers embarked from **Southampton**  
🔹 **Fare** had a strong positive skew and outliers  
🔹 **Age** had missing values, handled using **median**  
🔹 **Embarked** was imputed using **mode** (`S` - Southampton)
